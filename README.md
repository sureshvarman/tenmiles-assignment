## Total time spent on this assignment - 3 hours solid

## Features - which can be covered, if got more time
* tests
* more information on the weather, which is already there in API response
* cache in server side to avoid duplicate calls to the openweather api (any way the openweather api updated on every 2 hours, so cache invalidation can be applied for 2 hours).
